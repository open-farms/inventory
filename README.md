# Inventory üì¶

> An inventory service for managing farming vehicles, equipment, and resources.

## What is this?

- A REST API for managing farm inventory via HTTP requests
- A gRPC service for managing farm inventory between internal services

The inventory service enables users to keep track of farm inventory across multiple IoT devices, servers, applications, or databases. This service provides a foundational interface for inventory management and interaction.
