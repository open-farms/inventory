# Inventory üì¶

> An inventory service for managing farming vehicles, equipment, and resources.

![logo](./static/logo.png)

## What is this?

- A REST API for managing farm inventory via HTTP requests
- A gRPC service for managing farm inventory between internal services

The inventory service enables users to keep track of farm inventory across multiple IoT devices, servers, applications, or databases. This service provides a foundational interface for inventory management and interaction.

## Structure

```shell
/api # protobuf schemas, generated client, generated server
/cmd/inventory # api server
/cmd/inventoryctl # cli tool for service administration  
/config # default application configurations
/ent # database models, migrations, and drivers
/ent/schemas # editable database models
/internal/biz # business logic used by both api and cli
/internal/service # handlers for gRPC and HTTP endpoints
/internal/settings # settings package to read in application configs
/third_party # protobuf libraries
```

## Quickstart ‚ö°

You can either install inventory directly with go, build the project from source, or [download a binary from the latest release](https://github.com/open-farms/inventory/releases)

Install with `go install`

```shell
# Install the server
go install github.com/open-farms/inventory/cmd/inventory@latest

# Install the admin cli
go install github.com/open-farms/inventory/cmd/inventoryctl@latest
```


## Start the service üèÉ

Start the service directly with the binary or run it containerized with Docker.

```shell
# Run the inventory service
inventory
```

```shell
# Build the docker image
docker build -t <your-docker-image-name> .

# Run the docker image, exposing http and gRPC services
docker run --rm -v ./config:/data/config -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 <your-docker-image-name>
```

## Manage the inventory database with the [inventoryctl](./cmd/inventoryctl) CLI

```shell
# Start the postgres database
docker-compose up

# Run the inventoryctl cli to perform database migrations
inventoryctl --help
inventoryctl migrate
```

## Generate code and build from source üèóÔ∏è

Generate the protobuf code, openapi spec, and build from source

```
# Generate API files (include: pb.go, http, grpc, validate) by proto
make init
make api
make proto
make generate
make build
```

### Vehicles Service

The Vehicle schema and service allow for the management of vehicles on the farm.

```proto
message Vehicle {
	uint64 id = 1;
	string make = 2;
	string model = 3;
	string year = 4;
	bool active = 5;
	repeated string tags = 6;

	enum Condition {
		UNSPECIFIED = 0;
		MINT = 1;
		GOOD = 2;
		POOR = 3;
		BROKEN = 4;
	}

	Condition condition = 7;

	google.protobuf.Timestamp created_at = 8;
	google.protobuf.Timestamp updated_at = 9;
}
```

### Equipment Service

The Equipment schema and service allow for the management of equipment on the farm.

```proto
message Equipment {
	uint64 id = 1;
	string name = 2;
	repeated string tags = 3;

	enum Condition {
		UNSPECIFIED = 0;
		MINT = 1;
		GOOD = 2;
		POOR = 3;
		BROKEN = 4;
	};

	Condition condition = 4;
	google.protobuf.Timestamp created_at = 5;
	google.protobuf.Timestamp updated_at = 6;
}
```
